# Healthcare Fraud Detection â€“ CMS, Kaggle & Synthea Datasets

This project analyzes healthcare fraud patterns using three large-scale datasets:

1. **CMS Medicare Data** â€“ Public provider billing records with cost and service metrics.
2. **Kaggle Healthcare Fraud Dataset** â€“ Real-world data labeled with fraudulent claims.
3. **Synthea Synthetic Data** â€“ Comprehensive synthetic EHR data including patients, conditions, and claims.
